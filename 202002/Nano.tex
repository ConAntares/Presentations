    \subsection{Background}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Background}
As the basic functional unit of molecular electronics, the structure of single molecular nano-junction sandwiched between Nano-electrodes has been attracted many interests in molecular science. The charge transmission dynamics problems received increasing attention and have been subsequently studied extensively, in particular, its current voltage (IV) characteristics induced by an external field.

    \subsection{Theoretical Method}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Method Section}
In the system of molecular nano-junction which composed by a molecule between a pair of leads, with the method of extended General Master Equation, the characteristic curves of stationary and transient current have been computed and explained theoretically. It is found that the current can be evidently controlled via some factors adjustments, such as external field, the relaxation of molecules, intra-molecular vibration energy redistribution, and others.

\frametitle{Theoretical Model Description}
    The introduced electron-vibrational states, are used for an expansion of the overall molecular junction Hamiltonian:
\begin{equation}
    H = H_{mol} + H_{lead} + H_{mol-lead} + H_{mol-field}
\end{equation}
    The Hamiltonian of the molecular part:
\begin{equation}
    H_{mol} = \sum_{\alpha}\hbar\varepsilon_{\alpha}\ket{\psi_\alpha}\bra{\psi_\alpha}+\sum_{\alpha\beta}W_{\alpha\beta}\ket{\psi_\alpha}\bra{\psi_\beta}
\end{equation}
The quadratic quantized form of the Hamiltonian of leads:
\begin{equation}
    H_{lead} = \sum_{X=L,R}H_{lead}^X = \sum_{X=L,R}\sum_{k,s}\hbar\omega_{Xks}\alpha^\dagger_{Xks}\alpha_{Xks}
\end{equation}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Theoretical Model Description: Hamiltonian}
The Hamiltonian of the interaction between the leads and the molecule:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
    H_{mol-lead}= & \sum_{X=L,R}\sum_{k,s}T_X(N+1a,Nb,ks)\times\alpha_{Xks}\ket{\varphi_{N+1a}}\bra{\varphi_{Nb}}  \\
    + & \sum_{X=L,R}\sum_{k,s}T_X(Na,N+1b,ks)\times\alpha_{Xks}\ket{\varphi_{Na}}\bra{\varphi_{N+1b}} 
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Theoretical Model Description}
The coupling to the external optical field:
\begin{equation}
    H_{mol-field}(t)=-\sum_{\alpha,\beta}\ket{\alpha}\bra{\beta}\vec{d}_{\alpha\beta}\cdot\vec{E}(t)
\end{equation}
The filed form:
\begin{equation}
    \vec{E}(t) = \vec{n}\cdot E(t)e^{-i\omega t} + c.c.
\end{equation}
The general form of rate equation:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial}{\partial t} P_{\alpha}(t) = -\sum_{\beta}\left[P_{\alpha}(t) K_{\alpha\rightarrow\beta}(t)-P_{\beta}(t) K_{\beta\rightarrow \alpha}(t)\right]
\end{equation}
